### How to display it in your templates ?

Integrating the WordPress Carbon Calculator into your website's front-end templates is a breeze and allows you to display the calculated carbon emissions directly to your site visitors. 

In your front-end template files (such as your theme's template files or custom templates), you can access the carbon calculation method by using ```get_calculated_carbon()```. This method is available on any page of your site.

Here's an example of how you can use the code:

```php

<?php if($calculated_carbon = get_calculated_carbon() ): ?>
This page emits <?=round($calculated_carbon,2)?>g eq. COâ‚‚
<?php endif; ?>

```

The code snippet will display the calculated carbon emissions on the front-end of your website for your site visitors to see. It provides valuable information about the environmental impact of the current page.

By following these simple steps, you can raise awareness about the carbon footprint of your web content and encourage your audience to make more sustainable choices.

Feel free to customize the code or incorporate it into your templates as needed to fit your website's design and layout.

Remember, this feature adds a powerful environmental dimension to your website, aligning it with eco-conscious principles and contributing to a greener digital landscape.
